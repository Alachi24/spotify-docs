# Getting Started with the Web API

This guide will walk you through making your first Spotify Web API call to retrieve an artist's metadata. Follow these simple steps to get started and unleash your creativity!

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up your Spotify developer account.
- How to request an access token using the Client Credentials flow.
- How to use the access token to fetch artist data.
- Tips for your next steps in API exploration.

Let’s dive in and get rocking!

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Spotify account (free or premium).
- cURL installed to make API calls. Download it [here](https://curl.se/download.html) or use your preferred package manager.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Account

Log in to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). If needed, review the latest [Developer Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms/) to complete your account setup.

#### Step 2: Create an App

An app provides the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** needed to request an access token. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Dashboard and click **Create an App**.
2. Fill in the details:
   - **App Name**: My First Spotify App
   - **App Description**: A simple app to explore the Spotify API
   - **Redirect URI**: Use `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (not required for this example).
3. Check the **Developer Terms of Service** box and click **Create**.

You’ll now have access to your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

#### Step 3: Request an Access Token

An access token is a string that authorizes access to Spotify resources (e.g., artist data). Here’s how to get one using the Client Credentials flow:

1. Find your credentials:

   - Go to the Dashboard.
   - Click your app (e.g., My First Spotify App) and select **Settings**.
   - Note the **Client ID**. Click **View client secret** to reveal the **Client Secret**.

2. Request the token with this cURL command:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=your-client-id&client_secret=your-client-secret"

   ```

3. You’ll get a response like this (valid for 1 hour):
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "BQDBKJ5eo5jxbtpWjVOj7ryS84khybFpP_lTqzV7uV-T_m0cTfwvdn5BnBSKPxKgEb11",
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "expires_in": 3600
   }
   ```

### Request Artist Data

Let’s use the Get Artist endpoint to fetch an artist’s information. You’ll need the artist’s Spotify ID.

- Find the Spotify ID:

  - Open the Spotify Desktop App.
  - Search for an artist (e.g., Radiohead).
  - Click the three-dot icon on the profile, select **Share > Copy link to artist**, and copy the ID (e.g., `4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb`) from the URL.

- Make the API call with this cURL command (replace the token):

  ```bash
  curl "https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer BQDBKJ5eo5jxbtpWjVOj7ryS84khybFpP_lTqzV7uV-T_m0cTfwvdn5BnBSKPxKgEb11"
  ```

- If successful, you’ll see a response like this:

  ```json
  {
    "external_urls": {
      "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb"
    },
    "followers": {
      "href": null,
      "total": 7625607
    },
    "genres": [
      "alternative rock",
      "art rock",
      "melancholia",
      "oxford indie",
      "permanent wave",
      "rock"
    ],
    "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb",
    "id": "4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb",
    "images": [
      {
        "height": 640,
        "url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eba03696716c9ee605006047fd",
        "width": 640
      },
      {
        "height": 320,
        "url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616100005174a03696716c9ee605006047fd",
        "width": 320
      },
      {
        "height": 160,
        "url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000f178a03696716c9ee605006047fd",
        "width": 160
      }
    ],
    "name": "Radiohead",
    "popularity": 79,
    "type": "artist",
    "uri": "spotify:artist:4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb"
  }
  ```

  Congratulations! You’ve made your first Spotify Web API call!

### Summary

- The Spotify Web API offers endpoints for different data types (e.g., artists, albums).
- All API calls need an `Authorization` header with a valid access token.
- The Client Credentials flow is great for server-side calls (e.g., public data) but won’t work for user-specific data (e.g., private playlists).

### What’s Next?

- **Challenge:** Try using the [Search endpoint](#) to find artist IDs programmatically.
- **Learn More:** Check the [Authorization](#) Guide to pick the right flow for your project.
- **Deep Dive:** Read the [API Calls](#) Guide for detailed request and response info.
